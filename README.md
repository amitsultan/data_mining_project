This GitHub contains most of the files needed to run the notebook with the exception of a few large files that are automatically downloaded from San-Francisco dataset site. GitHub also contains a copy of the notebook. The notebook itself contains all the comments, thoughts, results, conclusion and some future work.
I collected all the data myself, most of the data was unorganized and not consistent across the years, for each section I collected the relevant data from different sources.
